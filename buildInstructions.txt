# To build

- Make sure you are on node v6
- install gitbook-cli 
`npm install -g gitbook-cli@2`

- do `gitbook install` to install the plugins
(I had to disable few older plugins since they disappeared from gitbook)

- do `gitbook install  --gitbook=2.3.2`

- do `gitbook build --gitbook=2.3.2`

- do `npm install gh-pages`

- `./node_modules/.bin/gh-pages -d _book`
